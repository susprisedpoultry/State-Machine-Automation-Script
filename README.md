# Introduction



# Things I'd like to get done
- Better status display in the terminal
- Maybe the ability for user-configured statuses and messages
- Support for naming groups instead of individual blocks
- Decide what to do with the min/max positions for rotors, hinges, and pistons (Ignore or Treat it as the movement done)
- Support for rebinding blocks on State enter instead of configuration (allows for detecting merged/connected blocks)
- Support for state transitions on errors (block not found for example)
- More actions and triggers 
- Support for configuring more than one machine
